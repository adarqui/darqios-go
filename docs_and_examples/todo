/policies /policies/get/{name}
Critical_Notes []string in Policy
/query/{..} -> a powerful query route which can pull info based on accounts, groups, and timestamps etc
Load policy: idx last1min, last5min, last10min
Allow a policy to 'fall through' to default if not specified already -> ie for a host having a specific policy for / and then another match for /. Second match shouldn't hit if !specified is set, etc.
segfault/process killed/kernel oops checker -> hash dmesg
move "alert level" for some of those policies, that's grabbed from thresholds[], to idx: "!running:high"

an all clear alert, for when a server goes from missing to found

listeners, map indexed by proto:port?

custom tasks: {low,med,high,clear}
	- run a custom script (any executable), return json to stdout.. a few formats will be accepted.. store custom metrics in a seprate collection?

need disable/enable for some specific cases.. curl .../accounts/disable/blah, curl .../accounts/enable/blah


accounts:list -> add some other options, such as active {true|false} etc.

monster query: allow multiple graphs, separate #<data> into #{graph1},{graph2}, ... etc

load custom script data into cube

file exists/doesn't exist tasks
command output pipe task

fix disk free recovery etc.... alert seems to stay (no recovery msg)
